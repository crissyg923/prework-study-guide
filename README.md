# Prework Study Guide Webpage 

## Description

Provide a short description explaining the what, why, and how of your project. Use the following questions as a guide:

- My motivation for this project stems from my excitement about learning how to code.
- I built this project as a way to contain all of the new information that I am encountering while using my newfound knowledge in the process.
- This website will make the study process smoother for anyone that is learning to code.
- I learned how to put together a basic website using HTML, CSS, and Javascript.  Most importantly, I learned that every great repository contains a detailed README file.


## Usage

This site is broken up into four coding-related topics, which are HTML, CSS, Git, and Javascript. If you open the DevTools console, you can see JavaScript running!

Badges aren't necessary, but they demonstrate street cred. Badges let other developers know that you know what you're doing. Check out the badges hosted by [shields.io](https://shields.io/). You may not understand what they all represent now, but you will in time.

## Features

If your project has a lot of features, list them here.

## How to Contribute

If you created an application or package and would like other developers to contribute to it, you can include guidelines for how to do so. The [Contributor Covenant](https://www.contributor-covenant.org/) is an industry standard, but you can always write your own if you'd prefer.

## Tests

Go the extra mile and write tests for your application. Then provide examples on how to run them here.
